    <h2 class="title">Final Project: Streamlined 8-bit Adder<br>
    <small>by Nicholas Davis and Noah Kurinsky</small></h2>
        <br>
        <div class="container">
        <h2>Abstract</h2>

        <p>We propose to develop an 8-bit CMOS adder with look ahead
        carry, with the design goals of maximizing performance through careful stage
        sizing while minimizing chip area and sources of leakage current. We will additionally 
        add subtraction capabilities if possible through 1's complement subtraction, and 
        propose to optimize performance through careful design of crucial bottlenecks and smart 
        carry treatment.</p><br>
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>
        For our final project, we have chosen to create an 8-bit adder/subtractor. For our first
        iteration we have im- plemented this with carry lookahead logic, which will keep the time
        delay for the adder down by computing the carry out bit of each stage in parallel. In order
        to test our initial implementation we have broken down the adder into modular components.
        The 1s complimenter component takes in a control signal, and 8 bits of input. When the control
        signal is high, the 8 inputs are inverted, and when the control signal is low, they are left alone.
        </p>
        <p>
        For our design, we do not actually want to 1s compliment the second 8-bit number, but instead
        we want to have a 2s compliment system. The reason we broke out the 1s compliment logic into
        a separate module is because with our full adder implementation, as long as the control signal
        is tied to the carry-in for the first full adder and the carry logic, the second 8-bit number
        will be in effect 2s compliment (1s compliment + 1). As mentioned, the second module is a 1-bit
        full adder. This adder takes in 2 input bits, 1 carry-in bit and outputs a sum bit, a propagation
        bit and a generation bit. The last module in our design is the carry lookahead unit. This unit
        takes in 4 sets of propagation and generation bits (8 bits total) as well as the first carry-out
        bit in the system. The carry lookahead unit outputs 4 carry-out bits.
        </p>
        <p>The carry look ahead logic (implemented as a Carry Look-ahead Unit, or CLU) entails removing
        the carry function from the standard full adder, and computing carry bits in parallel to decrease
        the number of gates from input to output in the higher bits. The logic for this lookahead carry is
        simple for the carry in terms of the previous carry, generation, and propagation terms:
        $$ c_{i+1} = G_{i} + P_{i} $$
        $$ s_{i} = G_{i} \oplus P_{i} $$
        </p>
        <p>
        where $P_{i}$ and $G_{i}$ are computed by the full adder instead of a carry bit according to the following equations:
        $$ G_{i} = a_{i} \bullet b_{i} $$
        $$ P_{i} = a_{i} \oplus b_{i} $$
        </p>
        <p>
        where $a_{i}$ and $b_{i}$ represent input bits and $c_{i}$ is the carry input to the full adder. Using these equations,
        an equation for each carry can be generated in terms of only propagation, generation and the first carry
        input; this means each carry is no longer dependent on the previous carry and they can be computed quickly
        in parallel. The equations for a 4-bit CLU are seen below:
        $$\begin{eqnarray}
        c_{1} &amp;=&amp; G_{0} + P_{0}c_{0} \tag{5a}\\
        c_{2} &amp;=&amp; G_{1} + P_{1}G_{0} + P_{1}P_{0}c_{0} \tag{5b}\\
        c_{3} &amp;=&amp; G_{2} + P_{2}G_{1} + P_{2}P_{1}G_{0} + P_{2}P_{1}P_{0}c_{0} \tag{5c}\\
        c_{4} &amp;=&amp; G_{3} + P_{3}G_{2} + P_{3}P_{2}G_{1} + P_{3}P_{2}P_{1}G_{0} + P_{3}P_{2}P_{1}P_{0}c_{0} \tag{5d}
        \end{eqnarray}$$
        </p><br>
        <p>
        Here it is easy to see how larger bit implementations become
        excessively large.
        </p><br>
        <p>
        The final architecture represents a combination of carry-look ahead and ripple carry logic, 
        to balance the speed gained from the look-ahead logic with the complexity, area, and delay 
        inherent to 8-bit CLUs. We construct a 4-bit CLU, and use two rippled CLUs to compute 8-bit
        carry look-ahead logic with one ripple step. This is not necessarily as fast as a single 8-bit 
        unit, but is more efficient in terms of area and power. In the following section we detail the
        development process, and in the subsequent section we discuss our results. Finally, we briefly 
        discuss the direction we will take in our final project.
        </p><br>
        <h2>Procedure</h2>
        <p>
        To design the adder, we first constructed the basic functional modules out of the primitive gates
        designed in Part I of Lab 3. For each module, we constructed a schematic, verified it, and created
        a symbol view. Then , simulate the 1's compliment module, and the full adder module separately to
        make sure that they function correctly. Once all of the symbols have been completed and the schematics
        have been verified and simulated, take the symbols, and construct a schematic for the full 8-bit 2's
        compliment adder. Once the full schematic is complete, verify it, and simulate it using Verilog XL.
        When simulating the full schematic, use the appropriate values in the stimulus file as given in the lab.
        </p>
        <h3>1's Compliment Module</h3>
        <p>
        Our 1's compliment implementation is very simple. Each input bit is XORed with the control bit.
        Therefore, when the control is 1, all the bits will flip, and when the control is 0 the will stay
        the same. In the lab, it is specified that we create a separate module for 2's compliment, and not
        for 1's compliment, but in our design, the 2's compliment functionality is built into the overall
        design, and cannot be separated out. In our design, in order to complete the 2's compliment logic,
        the control signal for the 1's compliment module is tied to the carry-in of the least significant
        adder in the design. This completes the 2's compliment algorithm, which is essentially, to flip all
        of the bits in the second number, and add 1. Because we cannot separate the 2's compliment logic,
        we test our 1's compliment logic separately to show that it will work as expected. In order to test
        this module, we must simulate it using Verilog XL, and give the input signals a few different
        operating conditions (different input patterns). Because we know what the module is supposed to output
        given a set input, we can determine that the module has been implemented correctly by covering all
        possible edge cases, as well as a base case. In figure 1, you can see the output wave form of our
        simulation. As you can see, the module behaves as expected, and therefore we can move on to the next
        module.
        </p>

        Schematic" class="img-responsive">
        <h3>Full Adder Module</h3>
        <p>
        A traditional full adder takes in 3 bits (input A, input B, and carry-in) and outputs 2 bits 
        (sum, and carry-out). Because we are implementing our adder using carry lookahead logic, however,
        we must change the output of our full adder appropriately. Our full adder takes in 3 bits 
        (input A, input B, and carry-in), but it outputs 3 bits. These 3 bits are the sum, propagation bit,
        and generation bit. These two bits are determined by the following boolean algebra:
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
        The propagation and generation bits will be used later as inputs to the carry lookahead unit module.
        This module must be tested in the same way as the 1's compliment module, however, because it is only
        a 1-bit module, the test cases are much more limited. We will be using 8 of these modules in total,
        but as long as we can verify the design of the single 1 bit adder, we know that all of them will work.
        In figure 2, you can see the output waveform of the Verilog XL simulation. As you can see, the module
        behaves as expected, and therefore we can move on to the carry lookahead unit.
        </p>

        Schematic" class="img-responsive">
        <h3>Carry Look-Ahead Unit (CLU) Module</h3>
        <p>
        This module will compute 4 carry bits in parallel, which will significantly speed up our adder
        from the traditional ripple-carry implementation. These carry bits are generated in parallel by
        using the propagation and generation bits from each adder. Because of the algorithms for each
        carry bit, the hardware complexity is greater than that of a ripple-carry adder. This module is
        not simulated separately from the main adder since we have simulated the other 2 modules.
        Therefore, when we simulate the adder in its entirety, if there is a failure in the simulation,
        it must be in the carry lookahead unit. We implemented the carry lookahead unit using only NAND
        gates and inverters. This means that the hardware complexity of the unit will be larger than if we
        used AND/OR/inverter logic, but it will be easier to optimize on the transistor level, and can still 
        possibly be smaller in size.

        Schematic" class="img-responsive">
        <h3>Top Level Integration</h3>
        <p>
        The final product created by connecting all of our modules is the 8-bit 2s compliment carry look-ahead
        adder. This adder is made up of a single 1s compliment module, 8 full adders, and 2 4-bit carry lookahead
        units, as seen in the schematic in figure 10; the symbol we created for this circuit can be seen in
        figure 8. In the schematic, the digits of B, the second argument, are fed to the one’s complement block,
        which also takes the control line as input. This line specifies whether addition or subtraction is to be
        done, a 0 meaning addition and a 1 meaning subtraction. Treating this input also as the carry-in, we
        achieve 2’s complement addition, as we can treat the B argument as the one’s complement plus one when
        subtraction is requested. The two CLU units, each four bits wide, are at the bottom, and the propagate
        and generate signals are fed to the blocks accordingly. The full adders receive the carries from this CLU
        unit, and the final carry of the first unit is used as the carry in to the second unit and second four bit
        group.
        </p>
        <p>
        In order to verify that this adder works as expected, we implement 4 specific input cases given by the
        lab in order to verify that the module works, in addition to a simple initialization test case.
        These five test conditions are given as
        $$\begin{eqnarray}
        00000000 + 00000000 &amp;=&amp; 0 \; 00000000 \tag{A}\\
        01111111 + 00000001 &amp;=&amp; 0 \; 10000000 \tag{B}\\
        10001111 + 00000000 &amp;=&amp; 1 \; 00001110 \tag{C}\\
        00000000 - 00000000 &amp;=&amp; 1 \; 01111111 \tag{D}\\
        01111111 - 10001111 &amp;=&amp; 0 \; 11110000 \tag{E}\\
        \end{eqnarray}$$

        <p>
        We input the different cases into our stimulus file for this simulation, and run it using VERILOG XL.
        As shown in figure 4 the output of our adder was correct for every case. It successfully performed 
        addition and subtraction, and even was able to return 2's complemented sums (negative numbers). 
        </p><br>
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
        In this lab, we learned how to unit test our products using verilog simulations and cadence schematics.
        We created an end-to-end product, acceptance tested its functionality, and learned about the hardware
        development process. The combination of unit testing and acceptance testing is critical to understand
        in industry, and will help us have a faster and more accurate development cycle for the final project.
        As shown in our analysis, this lab was a success. Every module worked as expected, as did the final
        adder.
