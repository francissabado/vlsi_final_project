EE103: Intro to VLSI Design [Project Title]
===========================
Final Project
-------------
This repository is to store the code for the final project website.

The final project (By Nicholas Davis and Noah Kurinsky) is an 8-bit adder desinged at the VLSI level with the performance enhancements listed below:
- Delay minimization through stage sizing and efficient layout
- Power minimization through transistor and are reduction
