 INFO (VLOGNET-60): The stimulus name mapped table will not be printed in the 
 "testfixture.verilog" file. To print the stimulus name mapped table, set 
 simVerilogPrintStimulusNameMappingTable = t either in CIW or the .simrc file 
 before invoking Verilog netlister.
  
 INFO (VLOGNET-62): Database internal net names will be printed for floating instance ports. To prevent 
 them from being printed, set simVerilogProcessNullPorts = t either in CIW or 
 the .simrc file.
  
 INFO (VLOGNET-64): All cellviews in the design will be printed in the Netlist Configuration list. 
 If you want to print only those cellviews that need to be re-netlisted in the 
 list, set simVerilogIncrementalNetlistConfigList = t either in CIW or the 
 .simrc file.
  
 INFO (VLOGNET-66): Module ports will be printed without the port ranges. If you have split busses 
 across module ports you may get an incorrect netlist. To print module ports 
 with the port ranges, set simVerilogDropPortRange = nil either in CIW or the 
 .simrc file.
  
 INFO (VLOGNET-68): The initial state of stimulus of all inout pins is set to "z". To get inout 
 pins with initial state of "0", set hnlVerilogIOInitStimulusStr = "0" 
 either in CIW or the .simrc file.
  
 INFO (VLOGNET-120): Using connection by order (implicit connections) for all the stopping cells.
 
 INFO (VLOGNET-80): The library 'Adder', cell 'Inverter', and view 'functional' has been netlisted successfully.
